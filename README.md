# Snapper
A plugin for saving/loading the current appearance of a character and all applied mods

Get it from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ViviAshe/plugins/main/PluginMaster.json

# Usage
First, configure a working directory in the settings window.

For best results saving snapshots, take them outside of GPose.

To load snapshots, enter GPose and select an actor, then hit the Load button to select a folder containing a snapshot.

For best results loading, use actors spawned by [Brio](https://github.com/AsgardXIV/Brio) to load onto. I validate loading behavior against those actors and likely will be slow to fix any issues stemming from loading onto other actors.
